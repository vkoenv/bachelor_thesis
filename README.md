This repository contains a number of files that are of essence to my bachelor thesis. It contains zip files for the tool used in this thesis, courtesey of Marnix Suilen. Futhermore it contains 3 instances of the model used in my thesis. These are also the instaces I used in my results section. Finally it contains a java program to generate the observation space for models of different size. 
In order to use the tool you have to install the latest development version of [Storm and Stormpy](https://www.stormchecker.org/getting-started.html). Furthermore it requires you to have an installation of the [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver with its python API. I recommend carefullly reading the installation instructions of Storm since some of the dependencies between it and Stormpy are shared and need to be installed in a specific way.
In order to use the tool edit the solver.py file, at the bottom you can input your own model and property you want to check. An example model is included. Simply run the model by inputting "python3 solver.py" into your console.
